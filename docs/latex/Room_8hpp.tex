\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em \mbox{\hyperlink{classRoom}{Room}} class represents the \mbox{\hyperlink{classRoom}{Room}} abstraction. A \mbox{\hyperlink{classRoom}{Room}} object has different specifications, such as width and height. Furthermore, since we are interested in the conversion from real-\/world coordinates to Unity coordinates, it\textquotesingle{}s important to have some more informations, such as the axes\textquotesingle{} origins of the digital twin room and the camera\textquotesingle{}s coordinates\textquotesingle{} interval value. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
