 * @mainpage AI Watch A1 Documentation
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * This is the AI Watch A1 Documentation for C++. AI Watch A1 uses one Intel RealSense D435 camera and OpenPose in order to achieve 
 * multi-person 3D skeleton tracking. Once this task is completed, AI Watch A1 provides support to send each detected skeleton and 
 * its joint points' 3D coordinates (room and D435's details have to be specified) via Kafka, in order to let further detached 
 * computation possible.

 * @section install_sec Installation üöÄ
 * 1) Install [RealSense SDK 2.0](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) and its own dependencies.
 * 
 * 2) Install [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and its own dependencies.
 * 
 * 3) Install [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) and its own dependencies.
 * 
 * 4) Run the following command in your terminal:
 * ```
 * git clone --recursive git@github.com:dennewbie/AI_Watch_A1.git
 * ```
 * 
 * 5) From `/AI_Watch_A1/src/AI_Watch_A1/` folder, run the following commands in your terminal:
 *  
 * ```
 * mkdir build && cd build
 * ```
 * 
 * 6) Copy OpenPose's `models` folder to the project's build folder.
 * 
 * 7) Copy OpenPose's `BoostConfig.cmake`, `FindGFlags.cmake` and `FindGlog.cmake` files  to the `build/cmake/modules/` folder
 * 
 * 8) Run the following commands in your terminal:
 * 
 * ```
 * cmake .. && make -j \`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu\`
 * ```
 * 
 * 9) Now let's tart the Kafka environment. Run the following commands in a new terminal session. Set the environment variable for 
 * the Confluent Platform home directory:
 *   ```
 *   export CONFLUENT_HOME=confluent-7.2.1
 *   ```
 *   Add the Confluent Platform bin directory to your PATH:
 * 
 *   ```
 *   export PATH=$PATH:$CONFLUENT_HOME/bin
 *   ```
 *   Test your installation by running the confluent command:
 *   ```
 *   confluent --help
 *   ```
 *   Your output should show the available commands for managing Confluent Platform.
 *
 *   Start Confluent Platform by using the Confluent CLI confluent local services start command. This command starts all of the 
 *   Confluent Platform components, including Kafka, ZooKeeper, Schema Registry, HTTP REST Proxy for Kafka, Kafka Connect, ksqlDB, 
 *   and Control Center. 
 *   ```
 *   confluent local services start
 *   ```
 *
 *   Your output should resemble:
 *   ```
 *   Starting Zookeeper
 *   Zookeeper is [UP]
 *   Starting Kafka
 *   Kafka is [UP]
 *   Starting Schema Registry
 *   Schema Registry is [UP]
 *   Starting Kafka REST
 *   Kafka REST is [UP]
 *   Starting Connect
 *   Connect is [UP]
 *   Starting KSQL Server
 *   KSQL Server is [UP]
 *   Starting Control Center
 *   Control Center is [UP]
 *   ```
 *
 *   ### Important #1 üìå
 *   The confluent local commands are intended for a single-node development environment and are not suitable for a production environment. 
 *   The data that are produced are transient and are intended to be temporary. For production-ready workflows, see Install and Upgrade 
 *   Confluent Platform.
 *
 *   ### Important #2 üìå
 *   The Confluent CLI requires Java version 1.8 or 1.11.
 *   See [Confluent versions interoperability](https://docs.confluent.io/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html)
 * 
 * 10) Navigate to `http://localhost:9021` and create a new topic `t1` with default settings. Now go to `/AI_Watch_A1/src/AI_Watch_A1/` and 
 *     set up your [Kafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) parameters within the `configuration_file.ini` file. At this point:
 *   - if internal OpenPose execution is chosen, then run the following command in your terminal:
 *  
 * ```
 * sudo ./AI_Watch_A1.bin --num_gpu 1 --num_gpu_start 2 --image_dir rs_images/rgb --write_json op_output/op --logging_level 255
 * ```
 *   - if external OpenPose execution is chosen, then set up your OpenPose parameters within the "conf.conf" file, run the following command in your terminal:
 *
 * ```
 * sudo ./AI_Watch_A1.bin
 * ```
